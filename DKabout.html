			  <h3>Who am i, and why i chose this topic?</h3>
			  <p>My name is Amy and i am a student at 
			  NCI, currently studying Bachelors in computing.
			  I really love music, computers and science!</p>
			  
			  <p>The reason i chose to talk about the life on land in the Amazon 
			  is to try and spread awareness of just how bad it has gotten there.
			   I first learnt about the issues in the Amazon back in secondary
			   school during geography and since then i have been trying to spread
			   awareness. The Amazon is an essential part of our lives as humans
			   since it is home to at least 10% of the world's known species across
			   all types of life! I hope that from my research that i have managed
			   to educate some people and for them to spread the word.</p>
			   
			   <p>I hope you enjoyed reading about myself, thank you!</p>
